App-ZofCMS-Plugin-HTMLFactory-Entry

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS>. The module resides in
C<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::HTMLFactory::> namespace thus only provides some packed HTML code.

I use the HTML code provided by the plugin virtually on every site, and am sick and tired of
writing it! Hence the plugin.
